# Question

What is the job of a server application?

# Answer

A server application's job is to handle client requests and send appropriate responses or resources based on the request. Server applications act as the backbone of websites by enabling communication and functionality between clients and server-side resources.

The server listens for and accepts incoming requests from clients. These requests can include operations like data retrieval (e.g., GET), updates (e.g., PATCH), and more.

Once a request is received, the server processes it by interpreting the data and determining the appropriate response.

After processing the request, the server sends back a response, which could be a web page, data, error messages, or other resources.
