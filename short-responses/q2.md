# Question

`app.get(endpoint, controller)` takes in an `endpoint` as the first argument.

What is an endpoint in Express?

# Answer

In Express, an endpoint is the specific path or URL where a particular action (defined by a controller) will be executed when a client makes a request. It is the first argument of the `app.get()` method, and it defines the route or address where the request should be handled.

For example from the repo, `app.get('/about', serveAbout);`, the endpoint is `/about`, meaning that when a client makes a GET request to `/about`, the `serveAbout` controller will be invoked to handle that request.

Endpoints can be also be dynamic, like `/users/:id`, where the controller will handle requests for different user IDs.
